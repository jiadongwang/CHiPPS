These are quick install instructions mainly intended for UNIX-like systems
(including Linux, OS X, AIX, Cygwin and MSys). Additional details for building
this and other COIN projects are available at

Windows at

**********************************************************************

Pre-built binaries are available for some versions of ALPS on some
platforms. They can be downloaded at

  http://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Alps

If you would like to build from source, you can obtain the source code for
ALPS in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended). For this, you need a subversion client installed. For a
   command-line client, check out the code with

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CHiPPS/Alps/stable/1.3 Alps-1.3

2. Download the source in a compressed file from from
   http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Alps and
   extract it, for example, with

   tar -xzvf Alps-1.3.0.tgz

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CHiPPS

*** CONFIGURATION, COMPILE, INSTALLATION (UNIX-LIKE ENVIRONMENTS)  ***
**********************************************************************

1. Serial Library
-----------------

Switch to the directory in which you just downloaded or extracted the source
(e.g., Alps-1.0) and execute the following commands:

  1) ./configure
  2) make
  3) make test
  4) make install 

You might want to specify other options, in case you don't want to 
use the default choices that configure makes (e.g., compilers). 
Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools

and the CHiPPS Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CHiPPS

for more information.

2. Parallel Library (MPI as message passing interface) 
------------------------------------------------------

For configuration and and compilation of the MPI parallel solver, the user has
to specify the location of MPI with options --with-mpi-incdir, --with-mpi-lib,
MPICC, and MPICXX. Switch to the directory that you just downloaded or
extracted (e.g. Alps-1.3) and execute the following commands (substituting the
correct paths and command names).

  1) ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --with-mpi-incdir=/usr/local/mpich/include --with-mpi-lib='-L/usr/local/mpich/lib  -lmpich' MPICC=mpicc MPICXX=mpiCC
  2) make 
  3) make install

You might want to specify other options, in case you don't want to 
use the default choices that configure makes (e.g., compilers). 
Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools

and the CHiPPS project development page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/CHiPPS

for more information.

3. Building Examples
--------------------

To build example codes (ABC and KNAP), configure and build as above. Switch
into the appropriate subdirectory in the source distribution and type "make".
