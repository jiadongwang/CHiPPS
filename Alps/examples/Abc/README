WHAT IS ABC
============

Abc is an example of the applications developed on top of ALPS (See the README
of ALPS). Abc is a simple branch and cut solver for Mixed Integer Linear
Programming. Its only real purpose is to illustrate how to write an
application based on ALPS. BLIS is a serious, full-featured mixed integer
linear Programming (MILP) solver, which can be used to solve MILPs.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

The html documentation of the classes in ALPS (see the INSTALL file of ALPS)
can be created using doxygen. A user's guide is under preparation that will
help users to develop an application.


INSTALLATION
============

Please see the INSTALL file for a guide to install Abc.
